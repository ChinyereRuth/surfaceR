## 2023 Digital elevation data of North Western Territory


#'
#' A digital elevation model of NWT showing areas of high and low elevation. This project was created to see how areas of low and high elevation, and also places where the slope is steep contributes to fire database with 101 indicators aggregated to NUTS 2 statistical level. Data were collected from open sources by
#'  The sources where this data was gotten was from the USGS website. Link: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?projectId=2435656526 include data from the fields of education (ETER, Erasmus), science (USPTO, MA-Graph, GRID),
